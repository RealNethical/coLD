This is just a experimental pluggable layout editor for android .
Currently Lots of things need to be added like xml converter , more attributes , custom view maker etc.
Tyron's layout editor is recommended to be used as this editor is still in development.

# Contribution
I am a newbie android developer and don't know much about android.
The code is very messy as it was just written for learning purpose .

# Thanks
Tyron For making his layout editor open source
